# Password-Generator

## Description

My application allows a user to randomly generate a password after selecting certain criterias. I added each variable that I wanted to include in the form of an array and strings. One of the challenges I faced was getting my "generate" button to function properly. I also encountered an issue where I kept seeing undefined in the text-box instead of the values I assigned.
